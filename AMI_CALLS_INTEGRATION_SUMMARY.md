# üîî AMI Calls Integration with Calls Page - Complete Implementation

## üéØ **What Was Accomplished**

I have successfully updated your VOIP system so that **AMI connection calls (from extension 1412) now automatically appear and can be managed in the calls page**, just like phone simulator calls.

## ‚úÖ **Current Status: FULLY IMPLEMENTED**

Your system now handles **both types of calls** in the unified calls page:
- ‚úÖ **Phone Simulator Calls** (existing functionality)
- ‚úÖ **AMI Calls from Extension 1412** (newly implemented)

## üöÄ **New Features Added**

### 1. **Automatic AMI Call Detection**
- When someone calls extension 1412, the call automatically appears in the calls page
- Real-time Socket.IO notifications for immediate call display
- No manual intervention required

### 2. **Visual Distinction**
- **AMI calls** show with orange/warning styling and "AMI" badge
- **Phone simulator calls** show with blue/info styling and "Phone" badge
- Clear visual separation between call types

### 3. **Call Source Summary Cards**
- **AMI Calls (Extension 1412)** card showing count of AMI calls
- **Phone Simulator** card showing count of simulator calls
- Real-time updates as calls come in

### 4. **Source Filtering**
- Filter dropdown to show only AMI calls or only phone simulator calls
- Easy separation and management of different call types

### 5. **Unified Call Management**
- **Answer**: Works for both call types (uses appropriate backend)
- **Reject**: Works for both call types (uses appropriate backend)  
- **Hangup**: Works for both call types (uses appropriate backend)

## üîß **Technical Implementation**

### **Backend Changes (app_direct_mysql.py)**
```python
# AGIServer now emits multiple Socket.IO events:
- 'incoming_call_1412' (for extension1412.html)
- 'new_call' (for calls page)
- 'call_update' (for calls page)

# AMI calls are stored with source='ami' identifier
# Calls are added to active_calls for real-time management
```

### **Frontend Changes (calls.html)**
```javascript
# Enhanced call handling:
- answerCall() - detects AMI vs phone calls, uses appropriate endpoint
- hangupCall() - detects AMI vs phone calls, uses appropriate endpoint
- rejectCall() - detects AMI vs phone calls, uses appropriate endpoint

# New filtering and display:
- Source filter dropdown
- Visual AMI call styling
- Call source summary cards
```

## üì± **Call Flow for AMI Calls**

1. **Call Initiated**: Someone calls extension 1412
2. **Asterisk Routes**: Call goes to your AGI server (port 5001)
3. **AGI Processing**: Call details stored in database and active_calls
4. **Socket.IO Events**: Multiple events emitted for real-time updates
5. **Calls Page Update**: Call appears immediately with AMI styling
6. **User Action**: Admin can answer/reject/hangup from calls page
7. **AMI Control**: Actions sent back to Asterisk via AMI endpoints

## üé® **Visual Features**

### **AMI Call Styling**
- Orange border and background gradient
- "AMI" badge with phone icon
- "Extension 1412" indicator
- Distinct hover effects

### **Phone Simulator Call Styling**
- Blue border and background gradient  
- "Phone" badge with mobile icon
- Standard call appearance

### **Call Source Summary**
- Two summary cards showing call counts
- Color-coded for easy identification
- Real-time count updates

## üß™ **How to Test**

### **Test AMI Calls**
1. Start Flask app: `python app_direct_mysql.py`
2. Open calls page: `http://localhost:5000/calls`
3. Make a call to extension 1412 from your phone/SIP client
4. Watch the call appear in calls page with AMI badge
5. Test answer/reject/hangup functionality

### **Test Phone Simulator Calls**
1. Open phone simulator: `http://localhost:5000/phone`
2. Make a test call
3. Watch it appear in calls page with phone badge
4. Test call management from calls page

## üîç **Filtering Options**

### **Source Filter**
- **All Sources**: Shows all calls
- **AMI Calls**: Shows only extension 1412 calls
- **Phone Simulator**: Shows only simulator calls

### **Status Filter**

2. **Real-Time Updates**: See calls as they come in
3. **Visual Clarity**: Easy distinction between call types
4. **Efficient Management**: Handle both call types with same interface
5. **Professional Appearance**: Clean, modern call management system

## üîÆ **Future Enhancements**

The system is now ready for:
